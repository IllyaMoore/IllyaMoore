# About Me

## Who am I?  
I’m someone who loves building AI systems and tackling tricky problems with smart solutions.  
When I’m not deep in code, you’ll find me immersed in environmental puzzle platformers or metroidvanias —  
anything that rewards curiosity and clever thinking.

---

## What do I do?  
I work with **computer vision**, **generative models**, and **agent-based systems**.  
I like building things from the ground up — not just to make them work, but to really understand how and why they do.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into:
- Vision models  
- AI agents
